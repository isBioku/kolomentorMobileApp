# kolomentorMobileApp
This project is basically a Programming mentorship system... the manifesto and the problem this system tries to solve is to reduce the amount of time Tech
starters spend learning technical skills. 

//Many times, because of the diverse nature of technology, starters find it really challenging to map themselves with the appropriate knowledge and materials 
//they need. Although, information about how to start in any discipline are readilly available around the internet, but these information are scatterred and bringing 
//them all together to form a career path always seem to be a rocket science for self starters and as a result, many people quit learning technology almost immediately.

Finding it difficult to find a starting point is one problem that every starter face, another one is difficulty to stay on track and choosing the best type of project to 
// build. As simple as all these problems may seem, they have contributed into the reasons many people quit learning. 

//problem resolution, monitoring, guidance, motivation and encouragement are other challenges that starters face and especially self starters... All of these problems and other 
underlying ones are what KOLOMENTOR is trying to provide a handy solution to. 

Kolomentor tends to map a tech starter with the appropriate expert as a form of mentee to mentor relationship. A learner will have just 1 thing to worry about and that is 
//knowledge as kolomentor will take care of others 

// A mentor will outline a workable path of progress for all mapped mentee to follow and the project to be done at the completion of each level of skill... 
// A mentor will be able to share and update materials with all and individual mentee on a case by case basis. 
// A mentor will be able to provide a first hand technical assistance in problem resolution, by either sign posting the mentee to an external resource(s) or prioritise 
//the problem and solve it personally. 
//A mentee will not be able to move on to the next level until the mentor marks such mentee as satisfactory to move on to the next stage of knowledge. .. 
//This will be at the completion of the project associated with each skill level. 



//To be able to make all these possible, a mentee will be liable to pay a non mandatory fee. ... Every mentee that pays the non mandatory fee will have access to extra 
features of the kolomentor app.

1. like be able to message a mentor
2. Mentee will be able to request for personal assistance of the mentor which can therefore be carried out outside the kolomentor system
3. A mentor will be able to share connection with mentee
